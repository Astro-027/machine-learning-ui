# Machine Learning UI Project

This project is a web-based application designed to interface with various machine learning models for creating adversarial examples, enhancing models with deep Bayesian techniques, and visualizing results. It aims to provide an intuitive and interactive experience for users, particularly focusing on educational purposes and research at Benedict College.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Node.js (v12.x or later)
- npm (v6.x or later)

You can check your current versions with:

`node -v`

`npm -v`


### Installation

To get the application running on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**

First, clone the project repository to your local machine using Git:

https://github.com/Astro-027/machine-learning-ui.git

cd machine-learning-ui


2. **Install Dependencies**

Inside the project directory, install the necessary dependencies by running:

`npm install`

This command will install all the dependencies listed in the `package.json` file.

3. **Start the Application**

Once the installation is complete, you can start the application in development mode with:

`npm start`

This will run the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser. The page will automatically reload if you make edits.

4. **Build the Application**

For production deployment, you can build the app with:

`npm run build`


This command builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### Stopping the Application

To stop the application, use the `Ctrl + C` command in your terminal.
